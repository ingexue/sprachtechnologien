# Memorize: The git VCS

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) is the _de-facto_ state of the art [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).
- Some of you might remember [CVS (concurrent versions system)](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs) or [subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), geeks might also know of [mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/).
- Generally speaking, you should always use a version control system (VCS) when working on code, so you can keep track of changes.
- Print and laminate: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
- For the more visual: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html
- If you run into a mess (and you will): http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/git-pretty.png

# Automate: The Gradle Build Tool

![GBT](/assets/gradlebuildtool.png)
.center[https://gradle.org]

- `gradle init --type java-application` to bootstrap a project
- `./gradlew build` to use the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to be independent of locally installed Gradle
- `apply plugin: 'eclipse'` and `./gradlew eclipse` to generate Eclipse project files
- `apply plugin: 'idea'` and `./gradlew idea` to generate IntelliJ files (note: these are file-based project descriptions, not the new directory based `.idea/*`)
